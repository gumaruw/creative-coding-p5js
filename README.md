# Creative Coding with P5.js

This repository contains interactive, algorithm-driven sketches built with **P5.js**, blending **digital art**, **generative design**, and **data visualization**. The projects explore computational geometry, parametric systems, and dynamic visual outputs.

---

## Features
- 30+ algorithmic sketches hosted on Open Processing
- Use of **mathematical models** to scale visual outputs
- Generative design and interactive visualization
- Combines aesthetics with computational structures for meaningful digital art
- Continuous experimentation to push the boundaries of code as a design tool

## Installation

To run the sketches locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gumaruw/creative-coding-with-p5js-.git
2. Open the HTML files in a web browser, or use a local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
